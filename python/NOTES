I thought of doing edge detection using Gaussian difference and Canny. Canny
would be cool if I know a lot about edges. They might work but not such a great
idea.

Now the algorithm is following. Pick a pixel which is guaranteed to be on the
note and use "slither" algorithm.

Working. Can get notes. Need to check for harmonics now. If note does not have a
harmonic, reject it else accept it.
